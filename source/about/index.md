# Hi!  I'm Walter

I am an entrepreneur, founder and CEO of [Alekto](http://alekto.co); a [Triangle Startup Factory](http://trianglestartupfactory.com) Fall 2012 alumni company. Our team creates online software to help people maximize their credit scores while dealing with debt collectors.  This site is where I write about credit reporting, startups, and tinkering with technology.

I am a lifelong problem solver with a passion for improving the human condition.  When I was 12, I developed my first functional software application and I have been at it ever since.  Along the way I completed a [computer science](http://www.cs.gmu.edu/) degree, specializing in distributed and parallel computing, picked up an [MBA](http://som.gmu.edu/emba/) focusing on entrepreneurship and global strategy, and did stints at AOL and Microsoft.

This is my first step out of a lengthy communication blackout.  I had basically given up on blogging. But after reading [blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html), I am newly inspired.
