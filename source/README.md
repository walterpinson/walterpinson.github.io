## WALTERPINSON.COM

This serves as my personal blog.  It was initially built on Jekyll.  But I decided to migrate it to [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).  

Hexo leverages Jekyll but is built using NodeJS.  Additionally, it allows you to create content using markdown.  Thus, the tooling around hexo is quite rich.

### Organization
Thus far, hexo allows a single category per post.  The categories can be hierarchical, however, if that is desired.  Each post can have multiple tags.

#### Categories

* Do You Even Code?
* Do You Even Lift?
* Credit Reporting
* Blockchain
* Startup Life

#### Tags

* payments
* blockchain
* credit reporting
