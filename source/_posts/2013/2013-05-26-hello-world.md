### I'm back!  

It took me long enough.  But, I'm finally back from my long hiatus.  It's not like I don't have anything to talk about.  I've been meaning to start blogging again for the longest time.  I've just been super-busy.

Luckily, in the interim, I've grown quite fond of git and Github.  So when I came across the article, ["blogging like a hacker"][1] (which should be titled "blogging like a *BOSS*"), it was all the excuse I needed.  I could kill two birds with one stone.  ...tinker a bit.  ...and get back into blogging.

So my new blog is powered by [jekyll][2], hosted by [GitHub][3], and I'm writing this post using [prose][4].

Tight.
