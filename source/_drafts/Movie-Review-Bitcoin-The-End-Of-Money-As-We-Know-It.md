This movie is a fairly decent introduction to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general.  I give it 4 out of 6 Coins.  It's strength lies in its detailed treatment of money and the role it plays facilitating trade.  But it falls short in its actual coverage of Bitcoin.



It provides us with a history of how money has been used throughout history.  And finally it discusses the pitfalls associated with central government control of the money supply.

## Summary

### The Point
More than anything, this is a movie about money and commerce: the good, the bad, and the ugly.  In fact, one might view it is an indictment on money.  Fundamentally, BitCoin is just a new take on an old tool.  The question is, will this new money supplant old money?

### My Take
This documentary is quite useful for people who want to understand Bitcoin.  And not because is does a super great job explaining what Bitcoin is and how to use it.  The director, instead, offers an excellent history and primer on trade, money, commerce, and why the former necessitated the latter.

## General Review

### Strength
This movie does a wonderful job taking the viewer through the history of human trade and money and how the combination of the two gave way to commerce.  It goes into great detail of about the properties of money and the attributes that make a currency good or not so good.

### Weakness
Though the movie does cover Bitcoin, it only covers it very lightly.  A viewer looking for detailed explanation and insights into Bitcoin will be disappointed.  Bit coin is introduced and the basics are covered.  But that is the extent of the Bitcoin coverage.

### Highlight
It starts out describing why money is necessary.  Then it gets into the characteristics of money.

- scarce
- recognizable
- divisible
- fungible
- portable
