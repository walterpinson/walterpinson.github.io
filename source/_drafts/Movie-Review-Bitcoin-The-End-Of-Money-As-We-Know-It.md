excerpt: This movie is a fairly decent introduction to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general.  I give it 4 out of 6 Coins.  It's strength lies in its detailed treatment of money and the role it plays facilitating trade.  But it falls short in its actual coverage of Bitcoin.

This movie is a fairly decent introduction to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general.  I give it 4 out of 6 Coins.  It's strength lies in its detailed treatment of money and the role it plays facilitating trade.  But it falls short in its actual coverage of Bitcoin.

It starts out describing why money is necessary.  Then it gets into the characteristics of money.

- scarce
- recognizable
- divisible
- fungible
- portable

It provides us with a history of how money has been used throughout history.  And finally it discusses the pitfalls associated with central government control of the money supply.
