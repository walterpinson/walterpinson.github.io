## Misdirection

In [Francesco Corea's article about The Convergence of AI and Blockchain][1], he mentioned a theory put forth by Joel Monegro of Union Square Ventures.  According to Monegro's [Fat Protocols][2] theory, the current iteration of the internet is dominated by fat applications (Google / Facebook) on top of thin protocols (TCP/IP).  He suggests that blockchain will usher in an era of fat protocols and thin applications.  He bases this on the fact that the value that we see from blockchains, right now, is at the blockchain protocol level by way of smart contracts.

I think Monegro misses the mark.  It's early days for blockchain.  And the application use-cases have just not had a chance to understand and leverage the power of this new platform.  The same held true for the early days of TCP/IP.  The application layer was thin.  For those of us early adopters, SMTP, IRC Chat, USENETNEWS (NNTP), and text-based HTTP were the hot new applications.  And they were mighty then.  The application layer of the internet took a while to achieve it's "fat" status.  And so it will go, I predict, for blockchain.  He would be wise to not sell short the application layer.
Further, everyone knows that putting business logic in the database is evil.  It just doesn't scale.  I imagine that these issues will be resolved over time, however.  They must.
