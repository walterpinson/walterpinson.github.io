"Bail-ins" are a relatively unknown risk associated with centralized banking that can be mitigated with consumer adoption of cryptocurrencies.  Centralized banking is inherently risky for consumers and bail-ins are just the latest addition to its growing portfolio of risk.  Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether, can offer protections agains bail-ins. However, replicating existing banking models by merely switching fiat currency with cryptocurrencies leaves consumers exposed to similar risks.

> Bail-ins are a thing? - me

Unless you've been living under a rock, you know what is a bank bail-out.  That is when the government "loans" tax-payer money to failed banks in order to cover losses incurred due to risky speculation.  What you may not be aware of, is an alternative solution to that problem: the bail-in.

Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether, can offer protections agains some of the risks inherent in traditional banking; namely bail-ins.

# Conclusion


## Brainstorm
### Thesis
- Centralized banking is inherently unsafe for consumers and bail-ins are just the latest recent addition to its risk portfolio
- Cryptocurrencies can offer protection against the risk associated with centralized banking
- However, replicating existing banking models with cryptocurrencies poses similar risks

### Structure

#### Centralized banking is inherently unsafe for consumers and bail-ins are just the latest recent addition to its risk portfolio.

* We are all aware that many a big bank has proven too big to fail and taken poor risks and begged governments to bail them out with tax-payer money.
* The problem is that with the collapse of Glass-Steagall, these banks can hold savers hostage
* Bail-ins are another way that the banks can fuck consumers.
    * They can just take consumer deposits
    * Often times, consumers pension funds are invested in these banks via bonds; which results in the consumers getting fucked coming and going
* How Sway
    * As soon as a person deposits money with the bank, that person is no longer the owner of the asset.  The bank owns the asset.
    * The person has just become an an unsecured creditor to the bank.
    * The bank issues a promissory note to the person.  And now the bank is free to do whatever its wants to with its new money.
    * If a person believes that their money is safer in the bank than it is underneath their mattress, then it appears to be an even exchange.  But this exchange is now without risk.  And that risk appears to be growing.

#### Cryptocurrencies can offer protection against the risk associated with centralized banking
* Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, allow each person to be their own bank
* This is similar to keeping one's money under one's mattress
    * You are free from being required to trust a third-party with your funds
    * But you are responsible for the security of your money
    * Securing cryptocurrency is not as difficult as it sounds

#### However, replicating existing banking models with cryptocurrencies poses similar risks
* Simply using cryptocurrencies does not automatically protect one from classic banking risks
* Leveraging third-party exchanges to store cryptocurrencies in much the same way as we leverage banks to store our cash involves the same third-party risk.
    * People who stored their bitcoin at Mt Gox lost hella loot
    * Bitfinex bail-in gave users a 36% haircut

### Notes
* Context
    * Cypress keeps coming up in the crypto currency discussions.
    * The Cypriot government via the banks took all of the citizens money in what is called a Bail-in
    * The government passed legislation that allows banks to perform their own bail-ins should the bank find itself insolvent.
* What is a Bail-in?
    * May want to contrast this with Bail-outs
    * The term was coined by The Economist
* What is the risk to US consumers?
* How can cryptocurrency help?

A few points...

* There is a new word in the lexicon: getting *Cyprused*.
    * Many Italians and Cypriots were committing suicide after having been Cyprused
* Bank Relationships Demystified
    * Money that you deposit in a bank no longer belongs to you, it belongs to the bank
    * The bank issues you a promissory note
    * You become an unsecured creditor to the bank
    * If the bank folds, as a creditor, you can lose all of your money
* The US passed legislation that made derivatives liabilities more senior than depositors
    * 2005 bankruptcy law, which made derivatives liabilities most senior



> The US has already put in place bail-in-like powers as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act passed last year. The law includes a resolution scheme that gives regulators the ability to impose losses on bondholders while ensuring the critical parts of the bank can keep running.
> 
> Employees would be paid, the lights would stay on and derivatives contracts would not have to be instantly unwound, one of the areas that caused market confusion when Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008.
