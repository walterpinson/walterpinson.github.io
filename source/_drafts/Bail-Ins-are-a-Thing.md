Structure

* Context
    * Cypress keeps coming up in the crypto currency discussions.
    * The Cypriot government via the banks took all of the citizens money in what is called a Bail-in
    * The government passed legislation that allows banks to perform their own bail-ins should the bank find itself insolvent.
* What is a Bail-in?
    * May want to contrast this with Bail-outs
* What is the risk to US consumers?
* How can cryptocurrency help?

A few points...

* There is a new word in the lexicon: getting *Cyprused*.
    * Many Italians and Cypriots were committing suicide after having been Cyprused
* Bank Relationships Demystified
    * Money that you deposit in a bank no longer belongs to you, it belongs to the bank
    * The bank issues you a promissory note
    * You become an unsecured creditor to the bank
    * If the bank folds, as a creditor, you can lose all of your money
* The US passed legislation that made derivatives liabilities more senior than depositors
    * 2005 bankruptcy law, which made derivatives liabilities most senior



> The US has already put in place bail-in-like powers as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act passed last year. The law includes a resolution scheme that gives regulators the ability to impose losses on bondholders while ensuring the critical parts of the bank can keep running.
> 
> Employees would be paid, the lights would stay on and derivatives contracts would not have to be instantly unwound, one of the areas that caused market confusion when Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008.
