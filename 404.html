      Sorry dude. I really didn't want to do this. But, well..., you 
      tried to access a page that doesn't exist...
    </p>
    <p>
      Ok, we still can be friends... I'll help you with this. Go to our
      <a href="/">home</a>, and search for what you want. Just that easy.
    </p>
    <p>Sorry again for the inconvenience!</p>
    <p>I'll see you soon.</p>
