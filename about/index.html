<h1 id="Hi-I’m-Walter"><a href="#Hi-I’m-Walter" class="headerlink" title="Hi!  I’m Walter"></a>Hi!  I’m Walter</h1><p>I am an entrepreneur, founder and CEO of <a href="http://alekto.co" target="_blank" rel="external">Alekto</a>; a <a href="http://trianglestartupfactory.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Triangle Startup Factory</a> Fall 2012 alumni company. Our team creates online software to help people maximize their credit scores while dealing with debt collectors.  This site is where I write about credit reporting, startups, and tinkering with technology.</p>
<p>I am a lifelong problem solver with a passion for improving the human condition.  When I was 12, I developed my first functional software application and I have been at it ever since.  Along the way I completed a <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="external">computer science</a> degree, specializing in distributed and parallel computing, picked up an <a href="http://som.gmu.edu/emba/" target="_blank" rel="external">MBA</a> focusing on entrepreneurship and global strategy, and did stints at AOL and Microsoft.</p>
<p>This is my first step out of a lengthy communication blackout.  I had basically given up on blogging. But after reading <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html" target="_blank" rel="external">blogging like a hacker</a>, I am newly inspired.</p>
