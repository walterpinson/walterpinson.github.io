I've been watching a number of Bitcoin documentaries and movies as of late.  I figured that since I was investing the time to watch the movies, I may as well provide a review.  As I complete each review, you'll be able to navigate to them by clicking "My Take" in the table below.

Interestingly enough, Netflix does not (as of June 2017) have a single Bitcoin title available.  On the other hand, Amazon Prime Video has at least 11 documentaries and one feature film on the topic.

| Rank | Name | My Take
| :---: | :--- | :--- 
| 1 | [Banking on Bitcoin][1] | Shrem is a stoner; hands caught in cookie jar
| 2 | [Bitcoin: The End Of Money As We Know It][2] | Money has an interesting past and future
| 3 | [The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin][3] | Don't be fooled by temporary profit-taking
| 4 | [Magic Money: The Bitcoin Revolution][4] | We are unsecured creditors to our banks
| 5 | [The Bitcoin Story][5] | Anarchists, crooks, and cheapskates
| 6 | [Deep Web][6] | [The government crushed Ross Ulbricht][21]
