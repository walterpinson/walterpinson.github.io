I am an entrepreneur, founder and CEO of [Alekto][1]; a [Triangle Startup Factory][2] Fall 2012 alumni company. Our team creates online software to help people maximize their credit scores while dealing with debt collectors.  This site is where I write about credit reporting, startups, and tinkering with technology.

I am a lifelong problem solver with a passion for improving the human condition.  When I was 12, I developed my first functional software application and I have been at it ever since.  Along the way I completed a [computer science][3] degree, specializing in distributed and parallel computing, picked up an [MBA][4] focusing on entrepreneurship and global strategy, and did stints at AOL and Microsoft.

This is my first step out of a lengthy communication blackout.  I had basically given up on blogging. But after reading [blogging like a hacker][5], I am newly inspired.
