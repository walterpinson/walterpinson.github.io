  <p>
    I am an entrepreneur, founder and CEO of <a href="http://alekto.co">Alekto</a>; a 
    <a href="http://trianglestartupfactory.com">Triangle Startup Factory</a> Fall 2012 alumni company.  
    Our team creates online software to help people maximize their credit scores while dealing 
    with debt collectors.  This site is where I write about credit reporting, startups, and tinkering 
    with technology.

    I am a lifelong problem solver with a passion for improving the human condition.  When I was 12, I 
    developed my first functional software application and I have been at it ever since.  Along the way I
    completed a <a href="http://www.cs.gmu.edu/ ">computer science</a> degree, specializing in distributed and  
    parallel computing, picked up an <a href="http://som.gmu.edu/emba/ ">MBA</a>, focusing on entrepreneurship 
    and global strategy,  and did stints at AOL and Microsoft.

    This is my first step out of a lengthy communication blackout.  I had basically given up on blogging. 
    But after reading <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html ">
    "blogging like a hacker"</a>, I am newly inspired.
